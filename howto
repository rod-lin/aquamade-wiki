## utils for uploading the pages

1. Every page need to be 'merged' with linked resources before being uploaded to iGEM
2. use `python3 merge.py file /<page_name>` to merge and upload the page to /Team:<TEAM_NAME><url>
   (mind the slash!)
3. upload.py will save a log file `log.html` for debuging 

4. OR just use `update.py [page name(in config.py)]` to update!!!(RECOMMENDED!!)

## html pages

1. `sub/*.html` are pages that are really uploaded to iGEM wiki
2. `main.html` are used for local tests

## local test

1. `npm start` to start server
2. goto `localhost:3141/main.html`
