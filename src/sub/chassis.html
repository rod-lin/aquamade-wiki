				While E.coli is the most common used strain for protein expression, it's not the best choice for industrial uses.We plan to implement our devices in B. subtilis in the future in consideration of the prons and cons listed below. B. subtilis are able to endure more severe environment as might encountered in the pickling process. They are also more suitable for large quantity of protein expression as they can secret the proteins into the environment more easily than E. coli. Moreover, though E.coli provides numerous advantages in initial attempts as it's used more oftenly and better-studied in lab, certain strains of E.coli might pose threat to human bodies as opportunistic pathogens that might cause illnesses when our bodies are under low immunologic reactivity conditions. In contrast, B. subtilis is already applied widely in food production and considered to be safe and beneficial for health.
