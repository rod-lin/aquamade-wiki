				We were invited to the headquarters of zhejiang qiumei food CO,LTD, and visited the integrated modern producing shop.<br>

				After comprehending the idea of our experiment, the boss of the company told us that this is a feasible method, and she is looking forward to a further and deeper cooperation.<br>

				Several lab assistants introduced to us by the boss promised to give us further technical support and financial aid.

				We came to China food administration and consulted about the related law. According to the chief engineer, we knew that the ultimate pickled products would be in accordance with the existing food safety standard. So we had to change our experiment goal; luckily, we found out that although the nitrite level in pickles is below the standard, the degrading process is time-consuming, thus it is still very useful to develop enzymes to decompose the nitrite and accelerate the producing velocity.

				We came to the lab again to gain deeper insight about the issue. We learnt that day4 to day11 is the peak of nitrite concentration; after that, the nitrite will decompose naturally in the pattern of hyperbola. In regular producing process, the flavor of pickles at 13 day is nearly equal to final product. The pickles cannot be put into market just because of the exceeding of nitrite level. Also, the engineer told us that our enzyme can digest nitrite efficiently and without poison. He was surprised that if our products work well, the period of pickles producing will shorten to 15 days from the former 30days
