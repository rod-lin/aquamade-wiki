				<h2>Differences between biosafety level</h2>
					<h3>BSL1</h3>
					<div class="dot"></div>Mechanical pipetting only (no mouth pipetting allowed)
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Safe sharps handling
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Avoidance of splashes or aerosols
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>aily decontamination of all work surfaces when work is complete
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Hand washing
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Prohibition of food, drinks and smoking materials in lab setting
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Personal protective equipment, such as; eye protection, gloves and a lab coat or gown
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Biohazard signs
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Using universal microbes: E.coli to extract enzymes.

					<h3>BSL2</h3>
					<div class="dot"></div>Eye protection and face shields can also be worn, as needed: wearing gas mask when preforming experiment related to NO and NO2
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>The laboratory has self-closing, lockable doors.
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>A sink and eyewash station should be readily available.
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Biohazard warning signs: note the poisonous chemical compound: methyl vionlogen, placing this compound elsewhere. 
					<br>
					<div class="dot"></div>Sustained directional airflow to draw air into the laboratory from clean areas towards potentially contaminated areas. Lab Access And Rules:
							<br>
							<div class="sec dot"></div>We wear aprons, goggles, gloves as required when doing experiment.
							<br>
							<div class="sec dot"></div>No eating and drinking on workspace
							<br>
							<div class="sec dot"></div>Wearing mask when it comes to the experiment of testing the activity of nor
